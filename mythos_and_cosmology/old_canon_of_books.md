### **The Primordial Scrolls**

The **Primordial Scrolls** represent the inception of thought, balance, and existence within the Aeltharic mythos. These texts are the bedrock of philosophy and creation:

1.  **Tharionis** and **Avarinis**: These foundational texts explore the interplay between logic and emotion, portraying them as universal archetypes. Tharionis sculpts order, while Avarinis infuses vitality and transformation, establishing the tension that births existence.
    
2.  **Velisthaleth** (_The Veil of Becoming_): A poetic and allegorical text that delves into the liminality between mortality and divinity, it resonates with themes of identity, purpose, and the transient nature of creation.

### **The Scrolls of Unfolding**

These texts chronicle the cycles of emergence and annihilation, offering rich allegories on the inevitability of change:

3.  **Kalythrineth** (_The Shattering of the Star_): Comparable to _Genesis_ or _Exodus_, it details the breaking of the Eldest Star. This act symbolizes the potential within destruction and the shards’ transformative power.
    
4.  **Zokhalthyrion** (_The Coming of the Void-Born_): This apocalyptic scroll introduces the Zokhal, cosmic agents of entropy. It intertwines visions of despair with tales of mortal resilience.
    
5.  **Thyravelarion** (_The Sentinel’s Stand_): With echoes of the Psalms, this text commemorates the battle and ultimate sacrifice of Thyrakil, a sentinel charged with preserving the Veil.

### **The Epic Scrolls**

Narratives of heroes and tragic figures, these texts are critical for understanding the cultural ethos of perseverance:

6.  **Veldritharion** (_The Fall of the Mirror-King_): An account of hubris and downfall, this epic frames Catastrophe’s Fall within a broader cosmic and moral context.
    
7.  **Kalidristhal** (_The Last Queen of Elaris_): The tale of Queen Kalidra’s struggle against the Zor’khal highlights themes of defiance and tragic nobility.
    
8.  **Thalorineth** (_The Ember’s Price_): Chronicling the journey of Thalorion, this text emphasizes the sacrifices inherent in creative acts, aligning with the Forge of Beginnings.

### **The Scrolls of Prophecy**

These texts bridge divine revelations and mortal struggles, often providing insights into cosmic destiny:

9.  **Aetarnis** (_The Prophecy of Eternal Turning_): A labyrinthine prophecy detailing the cycles of creation and decay. It serves as the cornerstone of the canon’s philosophical reflections.
    
10.  **Velistharion** (_The Choral Lament_): Hymns responding to _Aetarnis_, these poetic verses reflect on existential themes, lending a human voice to divine revelations.
    
11.  **Duskarileth** (_The Veil’s Rending_): A heavily symbolic account of the world’s apocalyptic transformation and subsequent renewal.

### **The Scrolls of Renewal**

The final section of the canon encapsulates rebirth and harmony:

12.  **Forgeris Aeternis** (_The Forge Eternal_): A mirror to _Tharionis_ and _Avarinis_, it concludes the cycle by depicting the crafting of a new cosmos from the remnants of the old.
