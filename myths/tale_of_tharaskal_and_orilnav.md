## **The Tale of Tharaskal and the Orilnav**

### **Introduction**
In the days of the early mariners, when the seas were untamed and the stars were the only guide, the Aeltharic people whispered tales of a benevolent being, **Tharaskal**, the Wind Dolphin. This creature, luminous and wise, was said to lead lost sailors to safety and teach them sacred knowledge to harmonize with the power of the storm.

### **The Myth**
One fateful night, the crew of the mighty ship **Orilnav** found themselves ensnared in the grasp of **Vyrthar**, a raging tempest that churned the sea into chaos. The stars, their faithful navigators, were hidden behind thick, malevolent clouds. The sailors, desperate and afraid, clung to the mast, offering prayers to the sea.

Amid the thunder and howling winds, a radiant glow emerged from the tumultuous waves. It was **Tharaskal**, its sleek, silvery form cutting through the storm with elegance. The creature emitted a soft, melodic hum that pierced through the cacophony, calming the sailors' hearts.

**Tharaskal** swam alongside the Orilnav, guiding it away from the jagged rocks hidden beneath the waves. The dolphin's glowing body lit a safe path through the storm, but as the tempest intensified, the sailors struggled to keep their course.

Realizing their plight, **Tharaskal** rose above the waves, and in a voice as clear as the morning sun, taught the crew a sacred chant: **"Vyr gynlur maranna thar ilyssar"** *(“Storm of the deep sea winds, calm by the sacred!”)*. With trembling voices, the sailors recited the chant, their words harmonizing with the rhythm of the storm.

The tempest began to abate. The winds softened, and the waves ceased their violent thrashing. As dawn broke, the **Orilnav** reached the safety of the **valk** (shore), where the sailors knelt in gratitude.

### **Cultural Significance**
The tale of **Tharaskal** became a cornerstone of Aeltharic maritime tradition. Sailors began invoking **Vyrthalas**, the sacred chant taught by Tharaskal, before every voyage, ensuring the stormy seas would yield to their harmony.

The **Orilnav**, once an ordinary vessel, became a symbol of divine favor and resilience. Its name was bestowed upon future ships built for exploration, each one carrying carvings of **Tharaskal** upon their bows.

### **Poetic Retelling**
Upon the waves of stormy seas,  
A light emerged, a guiding breeze.  
With glow divine and hum so sweet,  
Tharaskal led where stars retreat.

Your words alight, a sacred fire."  
Through waves subdued and winds made still,  
The Orilnav sailed by Tharaskal's will.
