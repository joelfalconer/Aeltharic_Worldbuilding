# Contributing to the Aeltharic Worldbuilding Repository

New contributors are welcome! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure your submissions create consistent worldbuilding and integrate smoothly into the repository.

## Basic Guidelines

- Use descriptive file names to make files self-explanatory. As an example, for timelines, use a file such as 'timeline_age_of_creation.md'.
- Reference existing files or definitions wherever possible without duplicating content. Using links or from other documents streamlines integrity.
- Use clear commit messages with a reference to the specific changes introduced.

## Naming Conventions
Ensure that all substantive submissions are specifically named for their path and scope. Examples:
- 'mythos_and_phlosophy.md' for a document that describes integral cosmology.
- 'timeline_fall_of_velorath.md' for the timeline event linked to a divine origin.
- 'character_profile_template.md' to standardize profiles for major individuals.

## Style
Follow the guidelines specified in 'CRONTBIUTING.MD' when contributing, such as consistent language use and agonized structures.
