# Coastal Dwellers: Culture and Mythology

## Overview
The Coastal Dwellers are a seafaring culture deeply connected to the mythos of Aeltharic. Their traditions, rituals, and societal structures reflect the dualities of the Velistharin: light and shadow, chaos and order, creation and destruction.

## Maritime Rituals
1. **Invocation of the Storm Deity Mavaris**
   - Performed during violent storms, this ritual seeks Mavaris’s guidance and protection.
   - Chant: _"Mavaris al thal, velor kalis thalas."_ ("Mavaris of the sea, illuminate our fragile journey through the waves.")

2. **Ceremony of the Eternal Tide**
   - A seasonal festival celebrating the cycles of renewal and balance.
   - Symbolism: Offerings of light (candles) and shadow (darkened vessels) are sent into the sea.

3. **Naming the Tides**
   - Each tide is personified and named after a mythic archetype or event, e.g., _Thalvethis_ (Ocean-Child) for a calm tide, _Xarunithal_ (Sorrow-Tide) for a rough tide.
